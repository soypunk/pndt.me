[Overcast][2] remains my favorite podcasting client for iOS. A new version was recently released and [Marco has written up a walkthrough of his Overcast 3 design decisions][1]. 

The new "now playing" card metaphor UI is probably my favorite change, as it really captures the best aspects of the card pattern from iOS 10 but improves the stickier parts. I also really appreciate the changes to the queue behavior because managing what is playing "up next" has easily been the biggest UI friction point for me. I'm a little sad to see the swipe-to-action table cell behavior go away but it is well known that "mystery UIs" is an anti-pattern and Apple hasn't pushed the swipe cell action gesture enough to encourage wide-spread adoption.
