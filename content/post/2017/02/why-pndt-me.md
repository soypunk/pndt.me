I have realized for a while that I am constrained by Twitter's 140 character limit and limited threading options. I do not see these limits as bugs or missing features on Twitter's part rather a sign that the words I want to share need a different home. On the Internet we have a home for longer form thoughts: blogs and personal website. 

Similarly another thing I need to be better about is writing up notes about the _many_ items I place in [Safari's Reading List][1]. 100s of links have worked their way through my Reading List and while they are often are shared or bookmarked I think I frequently forget to write down why it was worth my time to save these items for later reading. So my hope with this website is to get back to the roots of what made blogging great oh so long ago - curating an index of personally interesting URLs from the internet and documenting the experience.

That's the goal for now - move longer form thoughts away from Twitter and make sure I'm documenting what I was thinking while I was collecting so many URLs from the internet.
