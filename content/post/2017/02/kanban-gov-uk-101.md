Delivery (or how the "sausage gets made") in the software world is still largely consumed by the buzzword that makes most folks groan: Agile. That's a shame really as agile software development doesn't have to be difficult or time-consuming if you keep a level head about it. This write-up of [a dead-simple Kanban system from United Kingdom's Government publishing platform team][1] is what any team should read at the beginning if they want to get started with Kanban. One thing this approach assumes is that you have a functioning work culture that fosters positive and candid communication. If that's not the case where you work I suggest polishing your resume.
